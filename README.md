# Graphic-program

The graphics program allows you to make global and local changes on PPM(RGB) or PGM(B&W) files.

We have the option
- creating a negative
- implementation of an averaging filter
- PPM to PGM format conversions (RGB to B&W)
- displaying the photo using x-window
- save the file

The program is written in the C language. The lena.ppm file is an example file on which it is possible to perform the above-described functions
